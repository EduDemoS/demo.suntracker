# Solar Demonstrator "Sun-Tracker"

This "Sun-Tracker" is our most advanced demonstrator. Similar to a real sunflower, it turns its flower towards the sun to collect as much light as possible. Like the Modular Weather Station, it can send data to the Internet via MQTT. For your convenience there are two sets of instructions. One includes step-by-step instructions for building the complete Sun-Tracker. The other is an abbreviated version suitable for a four-hour workshop and assumes that all soldering and other preparatory work has already been completed.
